# Spawn

##### A better boilerplate generator

Spawn is a new library that aims to reduce the amount of boilerplate that you write in your code, thereby reducing the number of silly errors that you have to deal with.

### Core Principles

1. **Usability**: Spawn is designed to be easy to learn and able to be used even after the initial boilerplate has been generated
2. **Modularity**: Don't like the default templates or can't find exactly what you're looking for? It's extremely simple to write your own Spawn templates and integrate them with your project
